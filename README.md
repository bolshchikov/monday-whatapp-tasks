## Motivation
Managing tasks in Monday is great. However, their mobile app is quite cumbersome. Especially, if you are on the go/meeting or in any other context, you don't have time to find the correct board and fill the item. <br>
Whatsapp is a convenient conversational interface that can help to solve this issue. <br>
Simply text your task to number, bot will add it to the relevant board. <br>
Later on you can edit, fill description, owner and prioritize it whenever there's time for that.
